This Github page contains the source code for a proof-of-concept for a game with the working title "Hydra Defense".

In hydra defense, you play as a hydra and you have to defend against a number of enemies. The rapid-prototype for this game is very early along in development so far.

To run the game, clone the repo, and run the file Entry.py through a python interpreter
